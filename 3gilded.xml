<div1 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head>CHAPTER 24</head>

<p>
THE CAPITAL of the Great Republic was a new world
to country-bred Washington Hawkins. St. Louis was a greater city,
but its floating population did not hail from great distances,
and so it had the general family aspect of the permanent population;
but Washington gathered its people from the four winds of heaven,
and so the manners, the faces and the fashions there, presented
a variety that was infinite. Washington had never been in "society"
in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the ways of its wealthier
citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings. Consequently.
everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was a
new and wonderful revelation to him.
</p><p>
Washington is an interesting city to any of us. It
seems to become more and more interesting the oftener we visit
it. Perhaps the reader has never been there? Very well You arrive
either at night, rather too late to do anything or see anything
until morning, or you arrive so early in the morning that you
consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an hour or two
while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic. You cannot well
arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway corporation
that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town
or out of it takes care of that. You arrive in tolerably good
spirits, because it is only thirty-eight miles from Baltimore
to the capital. and so you have only been insulted three times
(provided you are not in a sleeping car --the average is higher,
there): once when you renewed our ticket after stopping over in
Baltimore, once when you were about to enter the 'ladies' car"
without knowing it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a lady's car, and once when you
asked the conductor at what hour you would reach Washington.
</p><p>
You are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake
their whips in your face as you step out upon the sidewalk; you
enter what they regard as a "carriage," in the capital,
and you wonder why they do not take it out of service and put
it in the museum: we have few enough antiquities, and it is little
to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve the
few we have. You reach your hotel, presently -- and here let us draw
the curtain of charity -- because of course you have gone to the wrong one.
You being a stranger, how could you do otherwise? There are a
hundred and eighteen bad hotels, and only one good one. The most
renowned and popular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one
known to history.
</p><p>
It is winter, and night. When you arrive, it was
snowing. when you reach the hotel, it was sleeting. When you went
to bed, it was raining. During the night it froze hard, and the
wind blew some chimneys down. When you got up in the morning,
it was foggy. When you finished your breakfast at ten o'clock
and went out, the sunshine was brilliant, the weather balmy and
delicious, and the mud and slush deep and all-pervading. You will
like the climate -- when you get used to it.
</p><p>
You naturally wish to view the city; so you take
an umbrella, an overcoat, and a fan, and go forth. The prominent
features you soon locate and get familiar with; first you glimpse
the ornamental upper works of a long, snowy' palace projecting
above a grove of trees, and a tall, graceful white dome with a
statue on it surmounting the palace and pleasantly contrasting
with the background of blue sky. That building is the capitol;
gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was to
cost $12,000,000, and that the government did come within $27,200,000
of building it for that sum.
</p><p>
You stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself
to a view, and it is a very' noble one. You understand, the capitol
stands upon the verge of a high piece of table land, a fine commanding
position, and its front looks out over this noble situation for
a city -- but it don't see it, for the reason that when the capitol
extension was decided upon, the property' owners at once advanced
their prices to such inhuman figures that the people went down
and built the city in the muddy low marsh <hi rend="italics">behind</hi> the temple
of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building, with its
imposing colonnades, its projecting, graceful wings, its picturesque
groups of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps, flowing
down in white marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon
a sorrowful little desert of cheap boarding houses.
</p><p>
So you observe, that you take your view from the
back of the capitol. And yet not from the airy outlooks of the
dome, by the way, because to get there you must pass through the
great rotunda: and to do that, you would have to see the marvelous
Historical Paintings that hang there, and the bas-reliefs -- and
what have you done that you should suffer thus? And besides, you
might have to pass through the old part of the building, and you
could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by a young lady
artist for $10,000-- and you might take his marble emancipation
proclamation, which he holds out in his hand and contemplates,
for a folded napkin; and you might conceive from his expression
and his attitude, that he is finding fault with the washing. Which
is not the case. Nobody knows what is the matter with him; but
everybody feels for him. Well, you ought not to go into the dome
anyhow, because it would be utterly impossible to go up there
without seeing the frescoes in it -- and why should vow be interested
in the delirium tremens of art?
</p><p>
The capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful
building, both within and without, but you need not examine it
now. Still, if you greatly prefer going into the dome, go. Now
your general glance gives you picturesque stretches of gleaming
water, on your left, with a sail here and there and a lunatic
asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a distant elevation,
you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells upon lovingly
through a blur of unmanly moisture, for its recalls your lost
boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it
blest and beautiful. Still in the distance, but on this side of
the water and close to its edge, the monument to the Father of
his Country towers out of the mud -- sacred soil is the customary
term. It has the aspect of a factory chimney with the top broken
off. The skeleton of a decaying scaffolding lingers about its
summit, and tradition says that the spirit of Washington often
comes down and sits on those rafters to enjoy this tribute of
respect which the nation has reared as the symbol of its unappeasable
gratitude. The Monument is to be finished, some day, and at that
time our Washington will have risen still higher in the nation's
veneration, and will be known as the Great-Great-Grandfather of
his Country. The memorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality
that is full of reposeful expression. With a glass you can see
the cow-sheds about its base, and the contented sheep nibbling
pebbles in the desert solitudes that surround it, and the tired
pigs dozing in the holy calm of its protecting shadow.
</p><p>
Now you wrench your gaze loose and you look down
in front of you and see the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching
straight ahead for a mile or more till it brings up against the
iron fence in front of a pillared granite pile, the Treasury building -- an
edifice that would command respect in any capital. The stores
and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are mean, and cheap,
and dingy, and are better left without comment. Beyond the Treasury
is a fine large white barn, with wide unhandsome grounds about
it. The President lives there. It is ugly enough outside, but
that is nothing to what it is inside. Dreariness, flimsiness,
bad taste reduced to mathematical completeness is what the inside
offers to the eve, if it remains vet what it always has been.
</p><p>
The front and right hand views give you the city
at large. It is a wide stretch of cheap little brick houses, with
here and there a noble architectural pile lifting itself out of
the midst -- government buildings, these. If the thaw is still going
on when you come down and go about town, you will wonder at the
short-sightedness of the city fathers, when you come to inspect
the streets, in that they do not dilute the mud a little more
and use them for canals.
</p><p>
If you inquire around a little, you will find that
there are more boarding houses to the square acre in Washington
than there are in any other city in the land, perhaps. If you
apply for a home in one of them, it will seem odd to you to have
the landlady inspect you with a severe eye and then ask you if
you are a member of Congress. Perhaps, just as a pleasantry, you
will say yes. And then she will tell you that she is "full."
Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and
there she stands, convicted and ashamed. She will try to blush,
and it will be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed.
She shows you her rooms, now, and lets you take one -- but she makes
you pay in advance for it. That is what you will get for pretending
to be a member of Congress. If you had been content to be merely
a private citizen, your trunk would have been sufficient security
for your board. If you are curious and inquire into this thing,
the chances are that your landlady will be ill-natured enough
to say that the person and property of a Congressman are exempt
from arrest or detention, and that with the tears in her eyes
she has seen several of the people's representatives walk off
to their several States and Territories carrying her unreceipted
board hills in their pockets for keepsakes. And before you have
been in Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe
her, too.
</p><p>
Of course you contrive to see everything and find
out everything. And one of the first and most startling things
you find out is, that every individual you encounter in the City
of Washington almost -- and certainly every separate and distinct
individual in the public employment, from the highest bureau chief,
clear down to the maid who scrubs Department halls, the night
watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy who purifies
the Department spittoons -- represents Political Influence. Unless
you can get the ear of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief
of a Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use his "influence"
in your behalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial
nature in Washington. Mere merit, fitness and capability, are
useless baggage to you without "influence." The population
of Washington consists pretty much entirely of government employ�s
and the people who board them. There are thousands of these employ�s,
and the have gathered there from even' corner of the Union and
got their berths through the intercession (command is nearer the
word) of the Senators and Representatives of their respective
States. It would be an odd circumstance to see a girl get employment
at three or four dollars a week in one of the great public cribs
without any political grandee to back her, but merely because
she was worthy, and competent, and a good citizen of a free country'
that "treats all persons alike." Washington would be
mildly thunderstruck at such a thing as that. If you are a member
of Congress (no offence), and one of your constituents who doesn't
know anything, and does not want to go into the bother of learning
something, and has no money, and no employment, and can't earn
a living, comes besieging you for help, do you say, Come, my friend,
if your services were valuable you could get employment elsewhere -- don't
want you here?" Oh, no. You take him to a department and
say, "Here, give this person something to pass away the time
at -- and a salary" -- and the thing is done. You throw him on
his country. He is his country's child, let his country support
him. There is something good and motherly about Washington, the
grand old benevolent National Asylum for the Helpless.
</p><p>
The wages received by this great hive of employ�s
are placed at the liberal figure meet and just for skilled and
competent labor. Such of them as are immediately employed about
the two Houses of Congress, are not only liberally paid also,
but are remembered in the customary Extra Compensation bill which
slides neatly through, annually, with the general grab that signalizes
the last night of a session, and thus twenty per cent. is added
to their wages, for -- for fun, no doubt.
</p><p>
Washington Hawkins' new life was an unceasing delight
to him. Senator Dilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington's
quarters were charming -- gas; running water, hot and cold; bathroom,
coal fires, rich carpets, beautiful pictures on the walls; books
on religion, temperance, public charities, and financial schemes;
trim colored servants, dainty food -- everything a body could
wish for. And as for stationery, there was no end to it; the government
furnished it; postage stamps were not needed -- the Senator's frank
could convey a horse through the mails, if necessary.
</p><p>
And then he saw such dazzling company. Renowned generals
and admirals who had seemed but colossal myths when he was in
the far west, went in and out before him or sat at the Senator's
table, solidified into palpable flesh and blood; famous statesmen
crossed his path daily; that once rare and awe-inspiring being,
a Congressman, was become a common spectacle -- a spectacle so common,
indeed, that he could contemplate it without excitement, even
without embarrassment; foreign ministers were visible to the naked
eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the President himself,
and lived. And more, this world of enchantment teemed with speculation -- the
whole atmosphere was thick with it -- and that indeed was Washington
Hawkins' native air; none other refreshed his lungs so gratefully.
He had found paradise at last.
</p><p>
The more he saw of his chief, the Senator, the more
he honored him, and the more conspicuously the moral grandeur
of his character appeared to stand out. To possess the friendship
and the kindly interest of such a man, Washington said in a letter
to Louise, was a happy fortune for a young man whose career had
been so impeded and so clouded as his.
</p><p>
The weeks drifted by; Harry Brierly flirted, danced,
added lustre to the brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently
"buzzed" and "button-holed" Congressmen in
the interest of the Columbus River scheme; meantime Senator Dilworthy
labored hard in the same interest -- and in others of equal national
importance. Harry wrote frequently to Sellers, and always encouragingly;
and from these letters it was easy to see that Harry was a pet
with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing through;
that the assistance rendered him by "old Dilworthy"
was pretty fair -- pretty fair; "and every little bit helps, you
know," said Harry.
</p><p>
Washington wrote Sellers officially, now and then.
In one of his letters it appeared that whereas no member of the
House committee favored the scheme at first, there was now needed
but one more vote to compass a majority report. Closing sentence:
</p><p>
"Providence seems to further our efforts."
</p><p>
(Signed,) "ABNER DILWORTHY, U.S.S.,
 <hi rend="italics">per Washington Hawkins, P. S."</hi>
</p><p>
At the end of a week, Washington was able to send
the happy news -- officially, as usual,--that the needed vote had
been added and the bill favorably reported from the Committee.
Other letters recorded its perils in Committee of the whole, and
by and by its victory, by just the skin of its teeth, on third
reading and final passage. Then came letters telling of Mr. Dilworthy's
struggles with a stubborn majority in his own committee in the
Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one, till a
majority was secured.
</p><p>
Then there was a hiatus. Washington watched every
move on the board, and he was in a good position to do this, for
he was clerk of this committee, and also one other. He received
no salary as private secretary, but these two clerkships, procured
by his benefactor, paid him an aggregate of twelve dollars a day,
without counting the twenty per cent. extra compensation which
would of course be voted to him on the last night of the session.
</p><p>
He saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and
struggle for its life again, and finally worry through. In the
fullness of time he noted its second reading, and by and by the
day arrived when the grand ordeal came, and it was put upon its
final passage. Washington listened with bated breath to the "Aye!"
"No!" "No!" "Aye!" of the voters
for a few dread minutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer.
He ran down from the gallery and hurried home to wait.
</p><p>
At the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived
in the bosom of his family, and dinner was waiting. Washington
sprang forward, with the eager question on his lips, and the Senator
said:
</p><p>
"We may rejoice freely, now, my son -- Providence
has crowned our efforts with success."


</p><p>
</p></div1><div1 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head>CHAPTER 25</head>

<p>
WASHINGTON sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that
night. To Louise he wrote:
</p><p>
"It is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart
is full of thankfulness for some manifestation of the Divine favor.
You shall know him, some day, my Louise, and knowing him you will
honor him, as I do."
</p><p>
Harry wrote:
</p><p>
"I pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a
tough job, there is no question about that. There was not a friend
to the measure in the House committee when I began, and not a
friend in the Senate committee except old Dil himself, but they
were all fixed for a majority report when I hauled off my forces.
Everybody here says you <hi rend="italics">can't</hi> get a thing like this through
Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on delivery,
but I think I've taught them a thing or two -- if I could only make
them believe it. When I tell the old residenters that this thing
went through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say,
'That's rather too thin.' And when I say thin or not thin it's
a fact, anyway, they say 'Come, now, but do you really believe
that?' and when I say I don't believe anything about it, I <hi rend="italics">know</hi>
it, they smile and say, 'Well, you are pretty' innocent, or pretty'
blind, one or the other -- there's no getting around that.' Why they
really do believe that votes <hi rend="italics">have</hi> been bought 
-- they do indeed. But let them keep on thinking so. I have found out
that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has a little gift
in the way of argument with men, he can afford to play for an
appropriation against a money bag and give the money' bag odds
in the game. We've raked in $200,000 of Uncle Sam's money, say
what they' will -- and there is more where this came from, when
we want it, and I rather fancy I am the person that can go in
and occupy' it, too, if I do say it myself, that shouldn't, perhaps.
I'll be with you within a week. Scare up all the men you can,
and put them to work at once. When I get there I propose to make
things hum."
</p><p>
The great news lifted Sellers into the clouds. He
went to work on the instant. He flew hither and thither making
contracts, engaging men, and steeping his soul in the ecstasies
of business. He was the happiest man in Missouri. And Louise was
the happiest woman; for presently came a letter from Washington
which said:
</p><p>
"Rejoice with me, for the long agony is over!
We have waited patiently and faithfully, all these years, and
now at last the reward is at hand. A man is to pay our family
$40,000 for the Tennessee Land! It is but a little sum compared
to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long to see the day
when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself, better
take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best
days in this miserable separation. Besides, I can put this money
into operations here that will increase it a hundred fold, yes,
a thousand fold, in a few months. The air is full of such chances,
and I know our family would consent in a moment that I should
put in their shares with mine. Without a doubt we shall be worth
half a million dollars in a year from this time -- I put it at the
very lowest   figure, because it is always best to be on the safe
side -- half a million at the very lowest calculation, and then your
father will give his consent and we can marry at last. Oh, that
will be a glorious day. Tell our friends the good news -- I want
all to share it."
</p><p>
And she did tell her father and mother, but they
said, let it be kept still for the present. The careful father
also told her to write Washington and warn him not to speculate
with the money, but to wait a little and advise with one or two
wise old heads. She did this. And she managed to keep the good
news to herself, though it would seem that the most careless observer
might have seen by her springing step and her radiant countenance
that some fine piece of good fortune had descended upon her.
</p><p>
Harry joined the Colonel at Stone's Landing, and
that dead place sprang into sudden life. A swarm of men were hard
at work, and the dull air was filled with the cheery music of
labor. Harry had been constituted engineer-in-general, and he
threw the full strength of his powers into his work. He moved
among his hirelings like a king. Authority seemed to invest him
with a new splendor. Col. Sellers, as general superintendent of
a great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could
be -- and more. These two grandees went at their imposing "improvement"
with the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering
the foundations of the globe.
</p><p>
They turned their first attention to straightening
the river just above the Landing, where it made a deep bend, and
where the maps and plans showed that the process of straightening
would not only shorten distance but increase the "fall."
They started a cut-off canal across the peninsula formed by the
bend, and such another tearing up of the earth and slopping around
in the mud as followed the order to the men, had never been seen
in that region before. There was such a panic among the turtles
that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found within
three miles of Stone's Landing. They took the young and the aged,
the decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide-water
in disorderly procession, the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs
bringing up the rear.
</p><p>
Saturday night came, but the men were obliged to
wait, because the appropriation had not come. Harry said he had
written to hurry up the money and it would be along presently.
So the work continued, on Monday. Stone's Landing was making quite
a stir in the vicinity, by this time Sellers threw a lot or two
on the market, "as a feeler," and they sold well. He
re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and
still had money left. He started a bank account, in a small way -- and
mentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too;
to everybody, in fact; but not as a new thing -- on the contrary,
as a matter of life-long standing. He could not keep from buying
trifles every day that were not wholly necessary, it was such
a gaudy thing to get out his bank book and draw a check, instead
of using his old customary formula, "Charge it." Harry
sold a lot or two, also -- and had a dinner party or two at Hawkeye
and a general good time with the money. Both men held on pretty
strenuously for the coming big prices, however.
</p><p>
At the end of a month things were looking bad. Harry
had besieged the New York headquarters of the Columbus River Slackwater
Navigation Company with demands, then commands, and finally appeals,
but to no purpose; the appropriation did not come; the letters
were not even answered. The workmen were clamorous, now. The Colonel
and Harry retired to consult.
</p><p>
"What's to be done?" said the Colonel.
</p><p>
"Hang'd if I know."
</p><p>
"Company say anything?"
</p><p>
"Not a word."
</p><p>
"You telegraphed yesterday?" "Yes,
and the day before, too." "No answer?"
</p><p>
"None -- confound them!"
</p><p>
Then there was a long pause. Finally both spoke at
once:
</p><p>
"I've got it!"
</p><p>
<hi rend="italics">"I've</hi> got it!"
</p><p>
"What's yours?" said Harry.
</p><p>
"Give the boys thirty-day orders on the Company
for the back pay.
</p><p>
"That's it -- that's my own idea to a dot. But
then -- but then --"
</p><p>
"Yes, I know," said the Colonel; "I
know they can't wait for the orders to go to New York and be cashed,
but what's the reason they can't get them discounted in Hawkeye?"
</p><p>
"Of course they can. That solves the difficulty.
Everybody knows the appropriation's been made and the Company's
perfectly good."
</p><p>
So the orders were given and the men appeased, though
they grumbled a little at first. The orders went well enough for
groceries and such things at a fair discount, and the work danced
along gaily for a time. Two or three purchasers put up frame houses
at the Landing and moved in, and of course a far-sighted but easy-going
journeyman printer wandered along and started the "Napoleon
Weekly Telegraph and Literary Repository" -- a paper with a
Latin motto from the Unabridged Dictionary, and plenty of "fat"
conversational tales and double-leaded poetry -- all for two dollars
a year, strictly in advance. Of course the merchants forwarded
the orders at once to New York -- and never heard of them again.
</p><p>
At the end of some weeks Harry's orders were a drug
in the market -- nobody would take them at any discount whatever.
The second month closed with a riot. Sellers was absent at the
time, and Harry began an active absence himself with the mob at
his heels. But being on horseback, he had the advantage. He did
not tarry, in Hawkeye, but went on, thus missing several appointments
with creditors. He was far on his flight eastward, and well out
of danger when the next morning dawned. He telegraphed the Colonel
to go down and quiet the laborers -- he was bound east for money
-- everything would be right in a week -- tell the men -- tell them
to rely on him and not be afraid.
</p><p>
Sellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached
the Landing. They had gutted the Navigation office, then piled
the beautiful engraved stock-books and things in the middle of
the floor and enjoyed the bonfire while it lasted. They had a
liking for the Colonel, but still they had some idea of hanging
him, as a sort of make-shift that might answer, after a fashion,
in place of more satisfactory game.
</p><p>
But they made the mistake of waiting to hear what
he had to say first. Within fifteen minutes his tongue had done
its work and they were all rich men.-- He gave every one
of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of Stone's Landing, within
a mile and a half of the future post office and railway station,
and they' promised to resume work as soon as Harry got east and
started the money along. Now things were blooming and pleasant
again, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on. The Colonel
divided with them the money he still had in bank -- an act which
had nothing surprising about it because he was generally ready
to divide whatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it
was owing to this very trait that his family spent their days
in poverty and at times were pinched with famine.
</p><p>
When the men's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone,
they hated themselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches,
but it was too late, now -- they agreed to hang him another time -- such
time as Providence should appoint.

RUMORS of Ruth's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill
traveled to Philadelphia in due time, and occasioned no little
undertalk among the Bolton relatives.
</p><p>
Hannah Shoecraft told another cousin that, for her
part, she never believed that Ruth had so much more "mind"
than other people; and Cousin Hulda added that she always thought
Ruth was fond of admiration, and that was the reason she was unwilling
to wear plain clothes and attend Meeting. The story that Ruth
was "engaged" to a young gentleman of fortune in Fallkill
came with the other news, and helped to give point to the little
satirical remarks that went round about Ruth's desire to be a
doctor!
</p><p>
Margaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised
or alarmed by these rumors. They might be true; she knew a woman's
nature too well to think them improbable, but she also knew how
steadfast Ruth was in her purposes, and that, as a brook breaks
into ripples and eddies and dances and sports by the way, and
yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth's nature to give back
cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness and pleasure,
to appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the sunshine, while
the current of her resolution flowed steadily on.
</p><p>
That Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play
of life -- that she could, for instance, be interested in that somewhat
serious by -- play called "flirtation," or take any delight
in the exercise of those little arts of pleasing and winning
which are none the less genuine and charming because they are
not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never suspected until she
went to Fallkill. She had believed it her duty to subdue her gaiety
of temperament, and let nothing divert her from what are called
serious pursuits. In her limited experience she brought everything to the
judgment of her own conscience, and settled the affairs of all
the world in her own serene judgment hall. Perhaps her mother
saw this, and saw also that there was nothing in the Friends'
society to prevent her from growing more and more opinionated.
</p><p>
When Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed -- though
it would not have been by her -- that a medical career did seem a
little less necessary for her than formerly; and coming back in
a glow of triumph, as it were, and in the consciousness of the
freedom and life in a lively society and in new and sympathetic
friendship, she anticipated pleasure in an attempt to break up
the stiffness and levelness of the society at home, and infusing
into it something of the motion and sparkle which were so agreeable
at Fallkill. She expected visits from her new friends, she would
have company, the new books and the periodicals about which all
the world was talking, and, in short, she would have life.
</p><p>
For a little while she lived in this atmosphere which
she had brought with her. Her mother was delighted with this change
in her, with the improvement in her health and the interest she
exhibited in home affairs. Her father enjoyed the society of his
favorite daughter as he did few things besides; he liked her mirthful
and teasing ways, and not less a keen battle over something she
had read. He had been a great reader all his life, and a remarkable
memory had stored his mind with encyclopedic information. It was
one of Ruth's delights to cram herself with some out of the way
subject and endeavor to catch her father; but she almost always
failed. Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it, and the
mirth of young people, and he would have willingly entered into
any revolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation
to Friends' society.
</p><p>
But custom and the fixed order are stronger than
the most enthusiastic and rebellious young lady, as Ruth very
soon found. In spite of all her brave efforts, her frequent correspondence,
and her determined animation, her books and her music, she found
herself settled into the clutches of the old monotony, and as
she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors, the medical scheme
took new hold of her, and seemed to her the only method of escape.
</p><p>
"Mother, thee does not know how different it
is in Fallkill, how much more interesting the people are one meets,
how much more life there is.
</p><p>
"But thee will find the world, child, pretty
much all the same, when thee knows it better. I thought once as
thee does now, and had as little thought of being a Friend as
thee has. Perhaps when thee has seen more, thee will better appreciate
a quiet life."
</p><p>
"Thee married young. I shall not marry young,
and perhaps not at all," said Ruth, with a look of vast experience.
</p><p>
"Perhaps thee doesn't know thee own mind; I
have known persons of thy age who did not. Did thee see anybody
whom thee would like to live with always in Fallkill?"
</p><p>
"Not always," replied Ruth with a little
laugh. "Mother, I think I wouldn't say 'always' to any one
until I have a profession and am as independent as he is. Then
my love would be a free act, and not in any way a necessity."
</p><p>
Margaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy.
"Thee will find that love, Ruth, is a thing thee won't reason
about, when it comes, nor make any bargains about. Thee wrote
that Philip Sterling was at Fallkill."
</p><p>
"Yes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a
very am using young fellow and not so serious-minded as Philip,
but a bit of a fop maybe."
</p><p>
"And thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?"
</p><p>
"I didn't prefer anybody, but Henry Brierly
was good company, which Philip wasn't always."
</p><p>
"Did thee know thee father had been in correspondence
with Philip?"
</p><p>
Ruth looked up surprised and with a plain question
in her eyes.
</p><p>
"Oh, it's not about thee."
</p><p>
"What then?" and if there was any shade
of disappointment in her tone, probably Ruth herself did not know
it.
</p><p>
"It's about some land up in the country. That
man Bigler has got father into another speculation."
</p><p>
"That odious man! Why will father have anything
to do with him? Is it that railroad?"
</p><p>
"Yes. Father advanced money and took land as
security, and whatever has gone with the money and the bonds,
he has on his hands a large tract of wild land."
</p><p>
"And what has Philip to do with that?"
</p><p>
"It has good timber, if it could ever be got
out, and father says that there must be coal in it; it's in a
coal region. He wants Philip to survey it, and examine it for
indications of coal."
</p><p>
"It's another of father's fortunes, I suppose,"
said Ruth. "He has put away so many fortunes for us that
I'm afraid we never shall find them."
</p><p>
Ruth was interested in it, nevertheless, and perhaps
mainly because Philip was to be connected with the enterprise.
Mr. Bigler came to dinner with her father next day, and talked
a great deal about Mr. Bolton's magnificent tract of land, extolled
the sagacity that led him to secure such a property, and led the
talk along to another railroad which would open a northern communication
to this very land.
</p><p>
"Pennybacker says it's full of coal, he's no
doubt of it, and a railroad to strike the Erie would make it a
fortune."
</p><p>
"Suppose you take the land and work the thing
up, Mr. Bigler; you may have the tract for three dollars an acre.
</p><p>
"You'd throw it away, then." replied Mr.
Bigler, "and I'm not the man to take advantage of a friend.
But if you'll put a mortgage on it for the northern road, I wouldn't
mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is willing. but Pennybacker,
you know, don't go much on land, he sticks to the legislature."
And Mr. Bigler laughed.
</p><p>
When Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about
Philip's connection with the land scheme.
</p><p>
"There's nothing definite," said Mr. Bolton.
"Philip is showing aptitude for his profession. I hear the
best reports of him in New York, though those sharpers don't intend
to do anything but use him. I've written and offered him employment
in surveying and examining the land. We want to know what it is.
And if there is anything in it that his enterprise can dig out.
he shall have an interest. I should be glad to give the young
fellow a lift."
</p><p>
All his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows
a lift, and shouldering the losses when things turned out unfortunately.
his ledger, take it altogether, would not show a balance on the
right side; but perhaps the losses on his books will turn out
to be credits in a world where accounts are kept on a different
basis. The left hand of the ledger will appear the right. looked
at from the other side.
</p><p>
Philip wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of
the bursting up of the city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement
scheme, of Harry's flight and the Colonel's discomfiture. Harry
left in such a hurry that he hadn't even time to bid Miss Laura
Hawkins good-bye, but he had no doubt that Harry would console
himself with the next pretty face he saw -- a remark which was thrown
in for Ruth's benefit. Col. Sellers had in all probability, by
this time, some other equally brilliant speculation in his brain.
</p><p>
As to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that
it was merely kept on foot for speculative purposes in Wall Street,
and he was about to quit it. Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered,
that he was coming East? For he was coming, in spite of a letter
from Harry in New York, advising him to hold on until he had made
some arrangements in regard to contracts, he to be a little careful
about Sellers, who was somewhat visionary, Harry said.
</p><p>
The summer went on without much excitement for Ruth.
She kept up a correspondence with Alice, who promised a visit
in the fall, she read, she earnestly tried to interest herself
in home affairs and such people as came to the house; but she
found herself falling more and more into reveries, and growing
weary of things as they were. She felt that everybody might become
in time like two relatives from a Shaker establishment in Ohio,
who visited the Boltons about this time, a father and son, clad
exactly alike, and alike in manners. The son, however, who was
not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father;
he always addressed his parent as "Brother Plum," and
bore himself altogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed
to put bent pins in his chair. Both father and son wore the long,
single-breasted collarless coats of their society, without buttons,
before or behind, but with a row of hooks and eyes on either side
in front. It was Ruth's suggestion that the coats would be improved
by a single hook and eve sewed on in the small of the back where
the buttons usually are.
</p><p>
Amusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends
was, it oppressed Ruth beyond measure, and increased her feeling
of being stifled.
</p><p>
It was a most unreasonable feeling. No home could
be pleasanter than Ruth's. The house, a little out of the city,
was one of those elegant country residences which so much charm
visitors to the suburbs of Philadelphia. A modern dwelling and
luxurious in everything that wealth could suggest for comfort,
it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept lawns, with groups of
trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with greenhouse,
grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away in
undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and
sang under forest trees. The country about was the perfection
of cultivated landscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions
of Revolutionary date, and sweet as an English country-side, whether
seen in the soft bloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late
October.
</p><p>
It needed only the peace of mind within, to make
it a paradise. One riding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing
a young girl swinging in the hammock on the piazza and intent
upon some volume of old poetry or the latest novel, would no doubt
have envied a life so idyllic. He could not have imagined that
the young girl was reading a volume of reports of clinics and
longing to be elsewhere.
</p><p>
Ruth could not have been more discontented if all
the wealth about her had been as unsubstantial as a dream. Perhaps
she so thought it.
</p><p>
"I feel," she once said to her father,
"as if I were living in a house of cards."
</p><p>
"And thee would like to turn it into a hospital?"
</p><p>
"No. But tell me father," continued Ruth,
not to be put off, "is thee still going on with that Bigler
and those other men who come here and entice thee?"
</p><p>
Mr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with
women about "business." "Such men have their uses,
Ruth. They keep the world active, and I owe a great many of my
best operations to such men. Who knows, Ruth, but this new land
purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler
in, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?"
</p><p>
"Ah, father, thee sees everything in a rose-colored
light. I do believe thee wouldn't have so readily allowed me to
begin the study of medicine, if it hadn't had the novelty of an
experiment to thee."
</p><p>
"And is thee satisfied with it?"
</p><p>
"If thee means, if I have had enough of it,
no. I just begin to see what I can do in it, and what a noble
profession it is for a woman. Would thee have me sit here like
a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to come and put me in
a cage?"
</p><p>
Mr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from
his own affairs, and he did not think it worth while to tell his
family of a performance that very day which was entirely characteristic
of him.
</p><p>
Ruth might well say that she felt as if she were
living in a house of cards, although the Bolton household had
no idea of the number of perils that hovered over them, any more
than thousands of families in America have of the business risks
and contingencies upon which their prosperity and luxury hang.
</p><p>
A sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of
money, which must be forthcoming at once, had found him in the
midst of a dozen ventures, from no one of which a dollar could
be realized. It was in vain that he applied to his business acquaintances
and friends; it was a period of sudden panic and no money. A hundred
thousand! Mr. Bolton," said Plumly. "Good God, if you
should ask me for ten, I shouldn't know where to get it."
</p><p>
And yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and
Small) came to Mr. Bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal
operation, if he could not raise ten thousand dollars. Only ten,
and he was sure of a fortune. Without it he was a beggar. Mr.
Bolton had already Small's notes for a large amount in his safe,
labeled "doubtful"; he had helped him again and again,
and always with the same result. But Mr. Small spoke with a faltering
voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant
of his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that
Mr. Bolton put by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted
the day to scraping together, here and there, ten thousand dollars
for this brazen beggar, who had never kept a promise to him nor
paid a debt.
</p><p>
Beautiful credit! The foundation of modern society.
Who shall say that this is not the golden age of mutual trust,
of unlimited reliance upon human promises? That is a peculiar
condition of society which enables a whole nation to instantly
recognize point and meaning in the familiar newspaper anecdote,
which puts into the mouth of a distinguished speculator in lands
and mines this remark: "I wasn't worth a cent two years ago,
and now I owe two millions of dollars."

<p>
IT WAS a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work
on his darling enterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion
that had been such refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out.
It was hard to come down to humdrum ordinary life again after
being a General Superintendent and the most conspicuous man in
the community. It was sad to see his name disappear from the newspapers;
sadder still to see it resurrected at intervals, shorn of its
aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed on with rhetorical
tar and feathers.
</p><p>
But his friends suffered more on his account than
he did. He was a cork that could not be kept under the water many
moments at a time.
</p><p>
He had to bolster up his wife's spirits every now
and then. On one of these occasions he said:
</p><p>
"It's all right, my dear, all right; it will
all come right in a little while. There's $200,000 coming, and
that will set things booming again. Harry seems to be having some
difficulty, but that's to be expected -- you can't move these big
operations to the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, you know. But Harry
will get it started along presently, and then you'll see! I expect the news
every day now.
</p><p>
"But Beriah, you've <hi rend="italics">been</hi> expecting it
every day, all along, haven't you?"
</p><p>
"Well, yes; yes -- I don't know but I have. But
anyway, the longer it's delayed, the nearer it grows to the time
when it will start -- same as every day you live brings you nearer
to -- nearer -- "
</p><p>
"The grave?"
</p><p>
"Well, no--not that exactly; but you can't understand
these things, Polly dear -- women haven't much head for business,
you know. You make yourself perfectly comfortable, old lady, and
you'll see how we'll trot this right along. Why bless you, <hi rend="italics">let
</hi>the appropriation lag, if it wants to -- that's no great matter -- there's
a bigger thing than that."
</p><p>
"Bigger than $200,000, Beriah?"
</p><p>
"Bigger, child? -- why, what's $200,000? Pocket
money! Mere pocket money! Look at the railroad! Did you forget
the railroad? It ain't many months till spring; it will be coming
right along, and the railroad swimming right along behind it.
Where'll it be by the middle of summer? Just stop and fancy a
moment -- just think a little -- don't anything suggest itself? Bless
your heart, you dear women live right in the present all the time -- but
a man, why a man lives
</p><p>
"In the future, Beriah? But don't we live in
the future most too much, Beriah? We do somehow seem to manage
to live on next year's crop of corn and potatoes as a general
thing while this year is still dragging along, but sometimes it's
not a robust diet, Beriah. But don't look that way, dear -- don't
mind what I say. I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to worry;
and I <hi rend="italics">don't,</hi> once a month, <hi rend="italics">do</hi> I, dear? But when
I get a little low and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome,
but it don't mean anything in the world. It passes right away.
I know you're doing all you can, and I don't want to seem repining
and ungrateful -- for I'm <hi rend="italics">not,</hi> Beriah -- you know I'm not, don't
you?"
</p><p>
"Lord bless you, child, I know you are the very
best little woman that ever lived -- that ever lived on the whole
face of the Earth! And I know that I would be a dog not to work
for you and think for you and scheme for you with all my might.
And I'll bring things all right yet, honey -- cheer up and don't
you fear. The railroad -- "
</p><p>
"Oh, I <hi rend="italics">had</hi> forgotten the railroad, dear,
but when a body gets blue, a body forgets everything. Yes, the
railroad -- tell me about the railroad."
</p><p>
"Aha, my girl, don't you see? Things ain't so
dark, are they? Now <hi rend="italics">I</hi> didn't forget the railroad. Now just
think for a moment -- just figure up a little on the future dead
moral certainties. For instance, call this waiter St. Louis.
</p><p>
"And we'll lay this fork (representing the railroad)
from St. Louis to this potato, which is Slouchburg:
</p><p>
"Then with this carving knife we'll continue
the railroad from Slouchburg to Doodleville, shown by the black
pepper:
</p><p>
"Then we run along the -- yes -- the comb -- to the tumbler -- that's
Brimstone:
</p><p>
"Thence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is
the salt-cellar:
</p><p>
"Thence to, to-- that quill  --  Catfish -- hand me
the pincushion, Marie Antoinette:
</p><p>
"Thence right along these shears to this horse,
Babylon:
</p><p>
"Then by the spoon to Bloody Run -- thank you,
the ink:
</p><p>
"Thence to Hail Columbia -- snuffers, Polly, please -- move
that cup and saucer close up, that's Hail Columbia:
</p><p>
"Then -- let me open my knife -- to Hark-from-the-Tomb,
where we'll put a candle-stick -- only a little distance from Hail
Columbia to Hark-from-the-Tomb down-grade all the way.
</p><p>
"And there we strike Columbus River -- pass me
two or three skeins of thread to stand for the river; the sugar
bowl will do for Hawkeye, and the rat trap for Stone's Landing -- Napoleon,
I mean --and you can see how much better Napoleon is located than
Hawkeye. Now here you are with your railroad complete, and showing
its continuation to Hallelujah and thence to Corruptionville.
</p><p>
"Now then -- there you are! It's a beautiful road,
beautiful. Jeff Thompson can out-engineer any civil engineer that
ever sighted through an aneroid, or a theodolite, or whatever
they call it--<hi rend="italics">he</hi> calls it sometimes one and sometimes the
other -- just whichever levels off his sentence neatest, I reckon.
But ain't it a ripping road, though? I tell you, it'll make a
stir when it gets along. Just see what a country it goes through.
There's your onions at Slouchburg -- noblest onion country that graces
God's footstool; and there's your turnip country all around Doodleville -- bless
my life, what fortunes are going to be made there when they get
that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of turnips -- if
there's any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress has
made an appropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn't
have done that just on conjecture, of course. And now we come
to the Brimstone region--cattle raised there till you can't rest -- and
corn, and all that sort of thing. Then you've got a little stretch
along through Belshazzar that don't produce anything now -- at least
nothing but rocks -- but irrigation will fetch it. Then from Catfish
to Babylon it's a little swampy, but there's dead loads of peat
down under there somewhere. Next is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia
country -- tobacco enough can be raised there to support two such
railroads. Next is the sassparilla region. I reckon there's enough
of that truck along in there on the line of the pocket-knife,
from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the-Tomb to fat up all the consumptives
in all the hospitals from Halifax to the Holy Land. It just grows
like weeds! I've got a little belt of sassparilla land in there
just tucked away unobtrusively waiting for my little Universal
Expectorant to get into shape in my head. And I'll fix that, you
know. One of these days I'll have all the nations of the earth
expect to --"
</p><p>
"But Beriah, dear --"
</p><p>
"Don't interrupt me, Polly -- I don't want you
to lose the run of the map -- well, <hi rend="italics">take</hi> your toy-horse, James
Fitz -- James, if you must have it -- and run along with you. Here,
now -- the soap will do for Babylon. Let me see -- where was I? Oh yes -- now
we run down to Stone's Lan -- Napoleon -- now we run down to Napoleon.
Beautiful road. Look at that, now. Perfectly straight line -- straight
as the way to the grave. And see where it leaves Hawkeye -- clear
out in the cold, my dear, clear out in the cold. That town's as
bound to die as -- well if I owned it I'd get its obituary ready,
now, and notify the mourners. Polly, mark my words -- in three years
from this, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness. You'll see. And
just look at that river -- noblest stream that meanders over the
thirsty earth! -- calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her weary
bosom! Railroad goes all over it and all through it -- wades right
along on stilts. Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half -- forty-nine
bridges from Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether -- forty-nine
bridges, and culverts enough to culvert creation itself! Hadn't
skeins of thread enough to represent them all -- but you get an idea -- perfect
trestle-work of bridges for seventy-two miles. Jeff Thompson and
I fixed all that, you know; he's to get the contracts and I'm
to put them through on the divide. Just oceans of money in those
bridges. It's the only part of the railroad I'm interested in, -- down
along the line -- and it's all I want, too. It's enough, I should
judge. Now here we are at Napoleon. Good enough country plenty
good enough -- all it wants is population. That's all right -- that
will come. And it's no bad country <hi rend="italics">now</hi> for calmness and
solitude, I can tell you -- though there's no money in that, of course.
No money, but a man wants rest, a man wants peace -- a man don't
want to rip and tear around <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the time. And here we go,
now, just as straight as a string for Hallelujah -- it's a beautiful
angle handsome up-grade all the way -- and then away you go to Corruptionville,
the gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers that ever -- good
missionary field, too. There ain't such another missionary field
outside the jungles of Central Africa. And patriotic? -- why they
named it after Congress itself. Oh, I warn you, my dear, there's
a good time coming, and it'll be right along before you know what
you're about, too. That railroad's fetching it. You see what it
is as far as I've got, and if I had enough bottles and soap and
bootjacks and such things to carry it along to where it joins
onto the Union Pacific, fourteen hundred miles from here, I should
exhibit to you in that little internal improvement a spectacle
of inconceivable sublimity. So, don't you see? We've got the railroad
to fall back on; and in the meantime, what are we worrying about
that $200,000 appropriation for? That's all right. I'd be willing
to bet anything that the very next letter that comes from Harry
will -- "
</p><p>
The eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and
brought a letter, warm from the post-office.
</p><p>
"Things <hi rend="italics">do</hi> look bright, after all, Ben
ah. I'm sorry I was blue, but it did seem as if everything had
been going against us for whole ages. Open the letter -- open it
quick, and let's know all about it before we stir out of our places.
I am all in a fidget to know what it says.
</p><p>
The letter was opened, without any unnecessary delay.

<head>CHAPTER 28</head>

<p>
WHATEVER may have been the language of Harry's letter
to the Colonel, the information it conveyed was condensed or expanded,
one or the other, from the following episode of his visit to New
York:
</p><p>
He called, with official importance in his mien,
at No.   Wall Street, where a great gilt sign betokened the presence
of the headquarters of the "Columbus River Slack-Water Navigation
Company. He entered and gave a dressy porter his card, and was
requested to wait a moment in a sort of ante-room. The porter
returned in a minute, and asked whom he would like to see?
</p><p>
"The president of the company, of course.
</p><p>
"He is busy with some gentlemen, sir; says
he will be done with them directly."
</p><p>
That a copper-plate card with "Engineer-in-Chief"
on it should be received with such tranquility as this, annoyed
Mr. Brierly not a little. But he had to submit. Indeed his annoyance
had time to augment a good deal; for he was allowed to cool his
heels a full half hour in the ante-room before those gentlemen
emerged and lie was ushered into the presence. He found a stately
dignitary occupying a very official chair behind a long green
morocco-covered table, in a room sumptuously carpeted and furnished,
and well garnished with pictures.
</p><p>
"Good morning, sir; take a seat -- take a seat."
</p><p>
"Thank you, sir," said Harry, throwing
as much chill into his manner as his ruffled dignity prompted.
</p><p>
"We perceive by your reports and the reports
of the Chief Superintendent, that you have been making gratifying
progress with the work. -- We are all very much pleased."
</p><p>
"Indeed? We did not discover it from your letters -- which
we have not received; nor by the treatment our drafts have met
with -- which were not honored; nor by the reception of any part
of the appropriation, no part of it having come to hand."
</p><p>
"Why, my dear Mr. Brierly, there must be some
mistake. I am sure we wrote you and also Mr. Sellers, recently -- when
my clerk comes he will show copies -- letters informing you of the
ten per cent. assessment."
</p><p>
"Oh, certainly, we got <hi rend="italics">those</hi> letters.
But what we wanted was money to carry on the work -- money to pay
the men."
</p><p>
"Certainly, certainly -- true enough -- but we credited
you both for a large part of your assessments -- I am sure that was
in our letters."
</p><p>
"Of course that was in -- I remember that."
</p><p>
"Ah, very well then. Now we begin to understand
each other."
</p><p>
"Well, I don't see that we do. There's two
months' wages due the men, and
</p><p>
"How? Haven't you paid the men?"
</p><p>
"Paid them! How are we going to pay them when
you don't honor our drafts?"
</p><p>
"Why, my d<hi rend="italics">ear</hi> sir, I cannot see how you
can find any fault with us. I an) sure we have acted in a perfectly
straightforward business way. Now let us look at the thing a moment.
You subscribed for 100 shares of the capital stock, at $1,000
a share, I believe?"
</p><p>
"Yes, sir, I did."
</p><p>
"And Mr. Sellers took a like amount?"
</p><p>
"Yes, sir.
</p><p>
"Very well. No concern can get along without
money. We levied a ten per cent. assessment. It was the original
understanding that you and Mr. Sellers were to have the positions
you now hold, with salaries of $600 a month each, while in active
service. You were duly elected to these places, and you accepted
them. Am I right?"
</p><p>
"Certainly."
</p><p>
"Very well. You were given your instructions
and put to work. By your reports it appears that you have expended
the sum of $9,640 upon the said work. Two months salary to you
two officers amounts altogether to $2,400 -- about one-eighth of
your ten per cent. assessment, you see; which leaves you in debt
to the company for the other seven-eighths of the assessment -- viz,
something over $8,000 apiece. Now instead of requiring you to
forward this aggregate of $16,000 or $17,000 to New York, the
company voted unanimously to let you pay it over to the contractors,
laborers from time to time, and give you credit on the books for
it. And they did it without a murmur, too, for they were pleased
with the progress you had made, and were glad to pay you that
little compliment -- and a very neat one it was, too, I am sure.
The work you did fell short of $10,000, a trifle. Let me see -- $9,640
from $20,000 -- salary $2,400 added -- ah yes, the balance due the company
from yourself and Mr. Sellers is $7,960, which I will take the
responsibility' of allowing to stand for the present, unless you
prefer to draw a check now, and thus
</p><p>
"Confound it, do you mean to say that instead
of the company owing us $2,400, we owe the company $7,960?"
</p><p>
"Well, yes.
</p><p>
"And that we owe the men and the contractors
nearly ten thousand dollars besides?"
</p><p>
<hi rend="italics">"Owe</hi> them! Oh bless
my soul, you can't mean that you have not paid these people?"
</p><p>
"But I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> mean it!"
</p><p>
The president rose and walked the floor like a man
in bodily pain. His brows contracted, he put his hand up and clasped
his forehead, and kept saying, "Oh, it is too bad, too bad,
too bad! Oh, it is bound to be found out -- nothing can prevent it -- nothing!"
</p><p>
Then he threw himself into his chair and said:
</p><p>
"My dear Mr. Brierson, this is dreadful -- perfectly
dreadful. It will be found out. It is bound to tarnish the good
name of the company; our credit will be seriously, most seriously
impaired. How could you be so thoughtless -- the men ought to have
been paid though it beggared us all."
</p><p>
"They ought, ought they? Then why the devil -- my
name is not Brierson, by the way -- why the mischief didn't the compa -- why
what in the nation ever became of the appropriation? Where <hi rend="italics">is</hi> 
that appropriation? -- if a stockholder may make so bold
as to ask."
</p><p>
"The appropriation? -- that paltry $200,000, do
you mean?"
</p><p>
"Of course -- but I didn't know that $200,000 was
so very paltry. Though I grant, of course, that it is not a large
sum, strictly speaking. But where is it?"
</p><p>
"My dear sir, you surprise me. You surely cannot
have had a large acquaintance with this sort of thing. Otherwise
you would not have expected much of a result from a mere <hi rend="italics">initial
</hi>appropriation like that. It was never intended for anything
but a mere nest egg for the future and <hi rend="italics">real</hi> appropriations
to cluster around."
</p><p>
"Indeed? Well, was it a myth, or was it a reality?
Whatever become of it?"
</p><p>
"Why the matter is simple enough. A Congressional
appropriation costs money. Just reflect, for instance. A majority
of the House committee, say $10,000 apiece -- $40,000; a majority
of the Senate committee, the same each -- say $40,000; a little extra
to one or two chairmen of one or two such committees, say $10,000
each -- $20,000; and there's $100,000 of the money gone, to begin
with. Then, seven male lobbyists) at $3,000 each -- $21,000; one
female lobbyist, $10,000; a high moral Congressman or Senator
here and there -- the high moral ones cost money, because they give
tone to a measure -- say ten of these at $3,000 each, is $30,000;
then a lot of small-fry country members who won't vote for anything
whatever without pay -- say twenty at $500 apiece, is $10,000; a
lot of dinners to members -- say $10,000 altogether; lot of jimcracks
for Congressmen's wives and children -- those go a long way -- you can
t spend too much money in that line -- well, those things cost in
a lump, say $l0,000 -- along there somewhere; -- and then comes your
printed documents -- your maps, your tinted engravings, your pamphlets,
your illuminated show cards, your advertisements in a hundred
and fifty, papers at ever so much a line -- because you've <hi rend="italics">got
</hi>to keep the papers all right or you are gone up, you know.
Oh, my dear sir, printing bills are destruction itself. Ours,
so far amount to -- let me see -- 10; 52; 22; 13; -- and then there's 11;
14; 33 -- well, never mind the details, the total in clean numbers
foots up $118,254.42 thus far!"
</p><p>
"What!"
</p><p>
"Oh, yes indeed. Printing's no bagatelle, I
can tell you. And then there's your contributions, as a company,
to Chicago fires and Boston fires, and orphan asylums and all
that sort of thing -- head the list, you see, with the company's
full name and a thousand dollars set opposite -- great card, sir -- one
of the finest advertisements in the world -- the preachers mention
it in the pulpit when it's a religious charity -- one of the happiest
advertisements in the world is your benevolent donation. Ours
have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and some cents up to
this time."
</p><p>
"Good heavens!"
</p><p>
"Oh, yes. Perhaps the biggest thing we've done
in the advertising was to get an officer of the U.S. government
of perfectly Himalayan official altitude, to write up our little
internal improvement for a religious paper of enormous circulation -- I
tell you that makes our bonds go handsomely among the pious poor.
Your religious paper is by far the best vehicle for a thing of
this kind, because they'll 'lead' your article and put it right
in the midst of the reading matter; and if it's got a few Scripture
quotations in it. and some temperance platitudes and a hit of
gush here and there about Sunday Schools, and a sentimental snuffle
now and then about 'God's precious ones, the honest hard-handed
poor,' it works the nation like a charm, my dear sir, and never
a man suspects that it is an advertisement; but your secular paper
sticks you right into the advertising columns and of course you
don't take a trick. Give me a religious paper to advertise in,
every time: and if you'll just look at their advertising pages,
you'll observe that other people think a good deal as I do -- especially
people who have got little financial schemes to make everybody
rich with. Of course I mean your great big metropolitan religious
papers that know how to serve God and make money at the same time -- that's
your sort, sir. that's your sort -- a religious paper that isn't
run to make money is no use to <hi rend="italics">us,</hi> sir, as an advertising
medium -- no use to anybody in our line of business. I guess our
next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters
out to Napoleon. Never paid them a cent; just filled them up with
champagne and the fat of the land, put pen, ink, and paper before
them while they were red-hot, and bless your soul when you come
to read their letters you'd have supposed they'd been to heaven.
And if a sentimental squeamishness held one or two of them back
from taking a less rosy view of Napoleon, our hospitalities tied
his tongue, at least, and he said nothing at all and so did us
no harm. Let me see -- have I stated all the expenses I've been at?
No, I was near forgetting one or two items. There's your official
salaries -- you can't get good men for nothing. Salaries cost pretty
lively. And then there's your big high-sounding millionaire names
stuck into your advertisement as stockholders -- another card, that -- and
they <hi rend="italics">are</hi> stockholders, too, but you have to <hi rend="italics">give</hi> them
the stock and non-assessable at that -- so they're an expensive lot.
Very, very expensive thing, take it all around, is a big internal
improvement concern -- but you see that yourself, Mr. Bryerman -- you
see that, yourself, sir."
</p><p>
"But look here. I think you are a little mistaken
about its ever having cost anything for Congressional votes. I
happen to know something about that. I've let you say your say -- now
let me say mine. I don't wish to seem to throw any suspicion on
anybody's statements, because we are all liable to be mistaken.
But how would it strike you if I were to say that <hi rend="italics">I</hi> was
in Washington all the time this bill was pending? -- and what if
I added that <hi rend="italics">I</hi> put the measure through myself? Yes, sir,
I did that little thing. And moreover, I never paid a dollar for
any man's vote and never promised one. There are some ways of
doing a thing that are as good as others which other people don't
happen to think about, or don't have the knack of succeeding in,
if they do happen to think of them. My dear sir, I am obliged
to knock some of your expenses in the head -- for never a cent was
paid a Congressman or Senator on the part of this Navigation Company."
</p><p>
The president smiled blandly, even sweetly, all through
this harangue, and then said:
</p><p>
"Is that so?"
</p><p>
"Every word of it."
</p><p>
"Well it does seem to alter the complexion of
things a little. You are acquainted with the members down there,
of course, else you could not have worked to such advantage?'
</p><p>
"I know them all, sir. I know their wives, their
children, their babies -- I even made it a point to be on good terms
with their lackeys. I know every Congressman well -- even familiarly."
</p><p>
  "Very good. Do you know any of their signatures?
Do you know their handwriting?"
</p><p>
"Why I know their handwriting as well as I know
my own -- have had correspondence enough with them, I should think.
And their signatures -- why I can tell their initials, even."
</p><p>
The president went to a private safe, unlocked it
and got out some letters and certain slips of paper. Then he said:
</p><p>
'Now here, for instance; do you believe that that
is a genuine letter? Do you know this signature here? -- and this
one? Do you know who those initials represent -- and are they forgeries?'
</p><p>
Harry was stupefied. There were things there that
made his brain swim. Presently, at the bottom of one of the letters
he saw a signature that restored his equilibrium; it even brought
the sun-shine of a smile to his face.
</p><p>
The president said:
</p><p>
"That name amuses you. You never suspected him?'
</p><p>
"Of course I ought to have suspected him, but
I don't believe it ever really occurred to me. Well, well, well -- how
did you ever have the nerve to approach him, of all others?"
</p><p>
"Why my friend, we never think of accomplishing
anything without his help. He is our mainstay. But how do those
letters strike you?"
</p><p>
"They strike me dumb! What a stone-blind idiot
I have been!"
</p><p>
"Well, take it all around, I suppose you had
a pleasant time in Washington," said the president, gathering
up the letters; "of course you must have had. Very few men
could go there and get a money bill through without buying a single -- "
</p><p>
"Come, now, Mr. President, that's plenty of
that! I take back everything I said on <hi rend="italics">that</hi> head. I'm a
wiser man to-day than I was yesterday, I can tell you.
</p><p>
"I think you are. In fact I am satisfied you
are. But now I showed you these things in confidence, you understand.
Mention facts as much as you want to, but don't mention <hi rend="italics">names
</hi>to <hi rend="italics">anybody.</hi> I can depend on you for that, can't I?"
</p><p>
"Oh, of course. I understand the necessity of
that. I will not betray the names. But to go back a bit, it begins
to look as if you never saw any' of that appropriation at all?"
</p><p>
"We saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it -- and
that was all. Several of us took turns at log-rolling in Washington,
and if we had charged anything for that service, none of that
$10,000 would ever have reached New York."
</p><p>
"If you hadn't levied the assessment you would
have been in a close place I judge?"
</p><p>
"Close? have you figured up the total of the
disbursements I told you of?"
</p><p>
"No, I didn't think of that."
</p><p>
"Well, let's see:
</p><p>
 Spent in Washington, say $191,000
</p><p>
 Printing, advertising, etc., say 118,000
</p><p>
 Charity, say 16,000
</p><p>
 Total $325,000
</p><p>
"The money to do that with, comes from
</p><p>
 Appropriation $200,000
</p><p>
 Ten per cent. assessment on capital of $1,000,000
. 100,000
</p><p>
 Total $300,000
</p><p>
"Which leaves us in debt some $25,000 at this
moment. Salaries of home officers are still going on; also printing
and advertising. Next month will show a state of things!"
</p><p>
"And then -- burst up,3 I suppose?" "By
no means. Levy another assessment. "Oh, I see. That's dismal."
</p><p>
"By no means."
</p><p>
"Why isn't it? What's the road out?" "Another
appropriation, don't you see?"
</p><p>
"Bother the appropriations. They cost more than
they come to."
</p><p>
"Not the next one. We'll call for a half a million -- get
it and go for a million the very next month."
</p><p>
"Yes, but the cost of it!"
</p><p>
The president smiled, and patted his secret letters
affectionately. He said:
</p><p>
"All these people are in the next Congress.
We shan't have to pay them a cent. And what is more, they will
work like beavers for us -- perhaps it might be to their advantage."
</p><p>
Harry reflected profoundly a while. Then he said:
</p><p>
"We send many missionaries to lift up the benighted
races of other lands. How much cheaper and better it would be
if those people could only come here and drink of our civilization
at its fountain head."
</p><p>
"I perfectly agree with you, Mr. Beverly. Must
you go? Well, good morning. Look in, when you are passing; and
whenever I can give you any information about our affairs and
prospects, I shall be glad to do it."
</p><p>
Harry's letter was not a long one, but it contained
at least the calamitous figures that came out in the above conversation.
The Colonel found himself in a rather uncomfortable place -- no $1,200
salary forthcoming; and himself held responsible for half of the
$9,640 due the workmen, to say nothing of being in debt to the
company to the extent of nearly $4,000. Polly's heart was nearly
broken; the "blues" returned in fearful force, and she
had to go out of the room to hide the tears that nothing could
keep back now.
</p><p>
There was mourning in another quarter, too, for Louise
had a letter. Washington had refused, at the last moment, to take
$40,000 for the Tennessee Land, and had demanded $150,000! So
the trade fell through, and now Washington was wailing because
lie had been so foolish. But he wrote that his man might probably'
return to the city, soon, and then he meant to sell to him, sure,
even if he had to take $10,000. Louise had a good cry -- several
of them, indeed -- and the family charitably forebore to make any
comments that would increase her grief.
</p><p>
Spring blossomed, summer came, dragged its hot weeks
by, and the Colonel's spirits rose, day by day, for the railroad
was making good progress. But by and by something happened. Hawkeye
had always declined to subscribe anything toward the railway,
imagining that her large business would be a sufficient compulsory
influence; but now Hawkeye was frightened; and before Col. Sellers
knew what he was about, Hawkeye, in a panic, had rushed to the
front and subscribed such a sum that Napoleon's attractions suddenly
sank into insignificance and the railroad concluded to follow
a comparatively straight course instead of going miles out of
its way to build up a metropolis in the muddy desert of Stone's
Landing.
</p><p>
The thunderbolt fell. After all the Colonel's deep
planning; after all his brain work and tongue work in drawing
public attention to his pet project and enlisting interest in
it; after all his faithful hard toil with his hands, and running
hither and thither on his busy' feet; after all his high hopes
and splendid prophecies, the fates had turned their backs on him
at last, and all in a moment his air-castles crumbled to ruins
about him. Hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing,
and down went Stone's Landing! One by one its meagre parcel of
inhabitants packed up and moved away, as the summer waned and
fall approached. Town lots were no longer salable, traffic ceased,
a deadly lethargy fell upon the place once more, the "Weekly
Telegraph" faded into an early grave, the wary tadpole returned
from exile, the bullfrog resumed his ancient song, the tranquil
turtle sunned his back upon bank and log and drowsed his grateful
life away as in the old sweet days of yore.
